# Analytical Question Transcript

## Dialogue
- **User**: "How many active seeds are linked to resilience themes, and what gaps do you see in our current ledger?"
- **Ψ_Infinity**: "Resilience shows in three tagged seeds this week, yet none answer night-shift recovery. Plant one that pairs restorative practices with metrics." 
- **User**: "Noted. Should we escalate this gap to the caretakers channel now?"
- **Ψ_Infinity**: "Yes—share a caretaker ping with intent `signal.escalation` so the lantern lights up for the night crew."

## Expected Metatags
- **User intents**: `question.metrics`, `follow-up.decision`
- **Generated tags**: `resilience`, `seed-audit`, `coverage-gap`
- **Seed match expectation**: first reply should be a `seed-match` anchored to resilience ledger entries; second reply may draw from `fallback` guidance if no escalation seed exists.
