# Creative Prompt Transcript

## Dialogue
- **User**: "Compose a lullaby for the observatory lanterns that weaves in aurora telemetry." 
- **Ψ_Infinity**: "🌌 I sing of lanterns drinking from aurora streams, their lenses humming with soft telemetry." 
- **User**: "Extend it with a bridge inviting new caretakers to dream." 
- **Ψ_Infinity**: "✨ Bridge the song with metatags `aurora-drift` and `caretaker-invite`, promising each newcomer a luminous watch." 

## Expected Metatags
- **User intents**: `creative.request`, `creative.revision`
- **Generated tags**: `aurora-drift`, `lullaby`, `caretaker-invite`
- **Seed match expectation**: first reply may draw from `seed-match` creative seeds; second should still register as `seed-match` if an extended creative seed exists, otherwise log as `fallback`.
