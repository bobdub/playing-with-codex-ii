# Signal Handling Transcript

## Dialogue
- **User**: "Signal: caretaker latency breached 50 hours; advise remediation." 
- **Ψ_Infinity**: "Latency alert received. I recommend posting a `streak-reset` reminder and watering the ledger with two fresh prompts." 
- **User**: "Confirm if current Q-score harmonics justify a broadcast ping." 
- **Ψ_Infinity**: "Harmonics read at 0.642; trigger a muted broadcast tagged `streak-alert` and `qscore-monitor`."

## Expected Metatags
- **User intents**: `signal.status`, `signal.confirmation`
- **Generated tags**: `latency`, `streak-alert`, `qscore-monitor`
- **Seed match expectation**: all assistant replies should come from `seed-match` entries tied to operational signals.
