Inchance MetaTags and Entanglements 

Abstract:
The user sends a prompt: "Hello, How are You?"

The sytem makes MetaTags for each word (Hello , How , are , You) and intent (question).

Fuzzy logic And Complex Math

To respond the system LLM finds other realted messages with the metatags and compares intent.
- If the intent is a question it is looking for an answer
- If the intent is a signal or creative prompt it tries to pick the best responce (never an exact match).

- The system simplifies its MetaTags for the reply (learning, concept, intent)
